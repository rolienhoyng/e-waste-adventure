The first report "Scam Recycling" shows 37 addresses in HK in the appendix starting on page 99, with geo-coordinates for about 2/3 of them. The second report (update 1, 2017) has another 12 listed and the third report (update 2, 2018) and other 4. So until now their research indicates that 53/205 trackers ended up in Hong Kong (while even more passed through the city but ended up elsewhere) and we must have about 35 exact geo-coordinates.
